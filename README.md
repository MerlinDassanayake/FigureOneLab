Figure One Lab (F1L) is an initiative to help people build a computational biology (compbio) portfolio by recreating Figure 1 of quality life science articles. After all, there is only so much you can learn from classes that are more concept than practice, Kaggle, EdX, etc.

A meaningful compbio project usually has a few key elements:
1. Question
2. Data
3. Method

Because the question-data-method space is so large, F1L has selected a limited set of questions, data, and computational methods to provide a reasonable starting point.

To maximize the transferability of your work, F1L insists on:
1. Python
2. Human data
3. Disease data
4. Omics, especially single-cell, data
5. Biological topics with clear relevance to human health

Topics you will encounter:
1. Neuroscience
2. Stem cell biology (brain organoids)
3. Cancer biology
4. Immunology
