# **Figure One Lab**
**Figure One Lab** (**F1L**) is an initiative to help people build a computational biology (compbio) portfolio by recreating Figure 1 of life science publications. The goal is to wrestle with the underlying data as the authors have in producing Figure 1. Taking apart then putting together the leading figure of, say, a Nature publication, is no small feat, and it makes for an excellent portfolio project.

# **Problem**
A strong compbio portfolio project consists of a compelling question/topic, relevant data, and methods to analyze the data. Because the number of possible question-data-method combinations is so large, most people never start due to decision paralysis. Of those who do start, many run into walls immediately due to inaccessible data and poorly maintained methods.

# **Solution**
To help you hit the ground running and to maximize the appeal of your work, F1L has thoughtfully curated a set of questions/topics, data, and methods that you can start with:
1. Questions are sourced from neuroscience, stem cell biology, cancer biology, and immunology publications. Figure 1 of these publications are our inspiration. They address topics of broad appeal to both academia and industry so you are working on problems that people actually care about.
2. Data are human, omics, and open-access (not behind a paywall). There is an emphasis on single-cell data because it is a rich data modality used in literally every field of biology.
3. Methods are well-documented Python packages. 

The main value that F1L provides are the Jupyter notebooks in which I demonstrate how a working computational biologist applies methods to data to define questions. Use these to get started. Your job is to modify/extend my initial analysis until you have mastered Figure 1.
