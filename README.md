Figure One Lab (F1L) is an initiative to help people build a computational biology (compbio) portfolio by recreating Figure 1 of life science publications. The goal is to wrestle with the underlying data as the authors have in producing Figure 1. Taking apart then putting together the leading figure of, say, a Nature publication, is no small feat, and it makes for an excellent portfolio project.

A strong compbio portfolio project consists of a compelling question/topic, relevant data, and methods to analyze the data. Because the number of possible question-data-method combinations is so large, many people don't know where to start, so they don't. F1L has selected a set of questions/topics, data, and computational methods to provide a reasonable starting point, as well as to maximize the transferability of your work:
1. Questions are sourced from the fields of neuroscience, stem cell biology, cancer biology, and immunology.
2. Data are human, omics, especially single-cell.
3. Methods are tried-and-true Python packages.
