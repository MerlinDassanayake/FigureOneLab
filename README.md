Figure One Lab (F1L) is an initiative to help people learn computational biology (compbio) by recreating Figure 1 of quality life science articles.

A meaningful compbio project usually has a few key elements:
1. Question
2. Data
3. Method

Because the question-data-method space is so large, F1L has pre-selected a limited set of questions, data, and computational methods to give you a reasonable starting point. As such, F1L is like a compbio makerspace.
