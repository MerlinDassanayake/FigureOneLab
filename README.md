Figure One Lab is a computational biology (compbio) makerspace to help people learn to do meaningful compbio work.

Rationale:
Computational biology is almost impossible to teach well in a classroom setting because it changes so quickly that the course materials have to be general and conceptual enough to have lasting relevance. Course content that is specific and practical becomes outdated easily. Course-based instruction also tends to be linear in nature, but that is not how computational biologists think. We think in systems and iterations.

This is where a makerspace comes in. Here I provide the materials to build, but you get to define what to build and then build it. In the process of making, you learn how computational biology works. It's hard, but interesting, work.

A meaningful compbio project usually has a few key elements:
Question
Data
Method

Because the question-data-method space is so large, Figure One Lab is designed to give you a reasonable starting point. I have provided the biological questions, the data to start with, and initial methods. Once you get started, you will identify more questions/data/methods to extend your own project.
