Figure One Lab (F1L) is an initiative to help people learn computational biology (compbio) by recreating Figure 1 of quality life science articles. After all, there is only so much you can learn from classes that are more concept than practice, Kaggle, EdX, etc.

A meaningful compbio project usually has a few key elements:
1. Question
2. Data
3. Method

Because the question-data-method space is so large, F1L has selected a limited set of questions, data, and computational methods to provide a reasonable starting point.
